HFQsim is an earthquake simulator to study the partitioning of seismic/aseismic slip and dynamics of earthquakes on a Heterogeneous strike-slip Fault, using a generalized model of a discrete fault governed by static/dynamic friction and creep in an elastic half-space. The simulator includes a feedback between frictional heat generated by earthquake slip and subsequent creep slip on the fault. HFQsim generates multiple realistic features of earthquakes (e.g., frequency-size statistics, spatio-temporal clustering including aftershock sequences, heterogeneous slip patterns). HFQsim and a script for specifying key input parameters are also available in the Quakeworx Science Gateway at [HFQsim | Quakeworx Gateway](https://qwx1.onescienceway.com/app/qwx1fabiohfqsim1).
